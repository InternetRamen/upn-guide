# Why create a website instead of using a website builder?
There are many benefits to using a custom website instead of a website builder like Weebly, Wix, Godaddy, and Squarespace.

## Cost-savings
Using a custom website saves money. Specifically, hosting a website on services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) usually cost next to nothing compared to other services. 

At this point in time, UPN uses the [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/websites/website-builder/plans-and-pricing) website creator that costs around $14.99 per month. With our solution, montly costs will be next to nothing, if not zero.

Additionally, most features that website builders provide (other than the actual builder) can often be substituted for other services. For example, website security through SSL certificates can easily be substituted with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), which is one of the most trusted companies for web security.

## Customization
Website builders often lock you into their platform and restrict your creativity. There is only so much you can do with the built in features of a website builder. Custom websites allow you to use modern web features and customize your website as much as you want. 

## Speed and load times
Custom websites can easily be configured to have blazing fast load times. Website builders on the other hand, often cannot.
