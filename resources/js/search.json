Specifically, hosting a website on services such as Vercel or GitHub Pages usually cost next to nothing compared to other services.","At this point in time, UPN uses the GoDaddy website creator that costs around $200 per year. With our solution, yearly costs will be only the cost of the domain.","Additionally, most features that website builders provide (other than the actual builder) can often be substituted for other services. For example, website security through SSL certificates can easily be substituted with CloudFlare, which is one of the most trusted companies for web security."]},{"l":"Customization","p":["Website builders often lock you into their platform and restrict your creativity. There is only so much you can do with the built in features of a website builder. Custom websites allow you to use modern web features and customize your website as much as you want."]},{"l":"Speed and load times","p":["Custom websites can easily be configured to have blazing fast load times. Website builders on the other hand, often cannot."]}],[{"l":"Web Security","p":["New features as of 1/19/2023","Automatic HTTPS Rewrites","Always use HTTPS","Auto Minify","Brotli"]}],[{"l":"How the UPN Blog was created","p":["The UPN Blog was created using Netlify CMS. We chose this Content Management System (CMS) because it allowed users to create, edit, and delete blog posts from the actual website rather than a third-party website. For example, we're able to edit posts from https://blog.upcountypreventionnetwork.org/admin rather than another website."]}],[{"l":"How to create a new post","p":["In this page, I'll guide you through create a new blog post using Netlify CMS.","First, log in through https://blog.upcountypreventionnetwork.org/admin","After logging in, you should see a screen similar to this screen.","Click \"New Blog\".
